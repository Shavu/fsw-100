                    In our family we love to be in nature, hiking is a huge part of who we are. We like to enjoy the beauty of nature and all it has to offer while in good company!
                    I have always loved photography, so naturally taking photographs during hikes only makes sense. Who doesn't want to take a part of natures beauty home with them?

                    I absolutely love sharing the beautiful pictures I take as well as the stories and location that goes with them. I will not deny I did have a specific spot that 
                    was my go to and many pictures took place there! However that trail is massive and spans far and wide, leaving plenty of opportunity for seeing new things and having
                    new experiences! <span> Montana</span> is a special place to me, the place that feels like home. If you are ever in need of a wonderful experience I definitely
                    reccomend a trip over, specifically to the <span>Paradise Valley</span> and <span>Ennis</span> regions! You will leave with absolutely stunning photos and memories 
                    that will last a life time!
