                    Hello fellow adventurers! My name is Jessica, I prefer to go by Jess. I am a mother to 3, and a nature lover at heart. 
                    The outdoors is my place to be. I have always felt a connection to nature and find it to be the place I am most inspired, 
                    I have a variety of hobbies that branch wildly, but nothing compares to being in the mountains. I cant wait to go back to 
                    washington for a beautiful rainy day hike! My dream hike is The Pacific Crest Trail, and one day I hope to achieve it! 
                    Above all I just love to learn and enjoy life to the fullest. 
                </p>
