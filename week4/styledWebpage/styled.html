<!-- 2022 Audi A8 First Look: A Sharpened Up Luxury Sedan -->
    <section class="justSomeContext">
        <h2> New luxury 2022 Audi A8 First Look: A Sharpened Up Luxury Sedan :</h2>
        <p> Audi has confirmed that an updated version of the A8 luxury sedan will be making its way to the US in 2022. 
            As of now, the new ultra-luxury Horch model will be sold only in China. Although, full U.S. specs aren't available
             yet, photos of the Europe-spec car indicate the changes in store for this flagship four-door. Key changes are seen
              in the headlights, taillights, and grille, which have all been reshaped. New wheel designs and new colors are 
              available, although it is unknown if all five newly available matte paint options will be offered in the U.S. 
              There are a few additions to the trim palette, and entertainment screens for the rear passengers are a new option.
             </p>

        <p> Changes to the A8's powertrain lineup are not expected but should include: a 335-hp turbo 3.0-liter V-6 in the 55 version, a 453-hp twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 in the 60, 
            and a 563-hp twin-turbo 4.0-liter V-8 in the S8. The plug-in hybrid with a combined 443 horsepower should continue on. The A8 will likely be available in the U.S. 
            only in its long-wheelbase A8L form. Lastly, Audi says the updated A8 won't reach the U.S. market for a while longer, but when it does pricing is expected
            to rise somewhat compared with the 2021 model base price of $87,545 for the A8L and $133,245 for the S8.</p>
