                <h3>2022 Cadillac XT6!</h3>
            <p class="textentry">
                <p class="date">Dec 22nd 2021</p> <br> If a three-row SUV from General Motors's prestige brand is on your wish list, 
                the 2022 Cadillac XT6 is the only option you have unless you have Escalade money (and space). The XT6 shares much of 
                its underpinnings and mechanical components with the GMC Acadia, but you wouldn't know it by looking at it. The Cadillac 
                sports a unique exterior and interior design that looks appropriately upscale. It can be had with your choice of a turbocharged 
                four-cylinder or naturally aspirated V-6 engine and either front- or all-wheel drive. The Sport trim comes with a torque-vectoring 
                rear differential, but even so it fails to deliver the same level of athleticism as key rivals such as the Audi Q7 and the BMW X5. 
                The XT6 instead is better suited for stylish family transport, similar to other utes such as the Acura MDX and the Lincoln Aviator. <a class="readmore"> read more..</a>

            <h3>Lexus RC 350!</h3>
            <p class="textentry">
                <p class="date">Dec 22nd 2021 </p> The RC is an interesting car because it looks inherently sporty; however, it fails to live up to that illusion.
                 That makes us question stepping up to the more powerful RC350, either with or without the F Sport package. Those looking for luxury and 
                 performance from a two-door coupe should consider one of its competitors, such as the Genesis G70 or the Audi A5 Sportback. Instead, we'd stick
                  with the entry-level RC300 that has all the style of the RC350 for less money. Those who want all-wheel drive can have it for about $2700 more.
                   We'd also opt for the Premium package that adds heated and ventilated front seats, rain-sensing wipers, and more. The individual options we 
                   like are the 19-inch wheels, parking sensors, sunroof, heated steering wheel, and the upgraded LED headlights.!<br> <a class="readmore"> read more..</a>

            <h3>2022 Dodge Charger! </h3>    
            <p class="textentry">
                <p class="date">Dec 22nd 2022</p>The 2022 Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat, which comes standard with 717 horsepower, is one helluva
                 family sedan. Not only are its big back seat and trunk great for taking more than two people on trips or just out to lunch, it 
                 accelerates so ferociously that the same passengers will be cussing up a storm or asking for an airsick bag­–or both. For an extra
                  dose of "hold onto your butts," the Redeye model boasts a ridiculous 797 horses and will hit 60 mph in 3.5 seconds on its way to 
                  a claimed 203-mph top speed. While all that power might be too much for some, the widebody-only Charger actually handles surprisingly 
                  well for its size. Just expect better communication from your in-laws than from its steering. Compared with high-performance, six-figure 
                  luxury cars such as the Mercedes-AMG GT63 S and Porsche Panamera Turbo S, the 2022 Charger SRT Hellcat is a great value. Too bad 
                  its interior looks like it came from a car that costs less than half its nearly $75,000 starting price—which it does. ! <br> <a class="readmore"> read more..</a>
