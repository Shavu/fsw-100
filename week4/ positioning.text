                <h3>A Close Encounter!</h3>
            <p class="textentry">
                <p class="date">June 13th 2017</p><br>This adventure was a very interesting one indeed, beartooth trail is aptly named. 
                Upon entering the hiking trail we passed this area and there were a few small animal prints however nothing truly 
                alarming. We continually heard sounds while hiking up the trail, when a storm started to roll in we decided to head back. 
                On the way down we found bear prints and I had to get a picture. How long after we passed this area did the bear pass us 
                by? Scary and fun all in one! <a class="readmore"> read more..</a>

                <h3>A Utah Beauty! </h3>
            <p class="textentry">
                <p class="date">July 24th 2016</p><br> This beauty was taken at causy in northern Utah, the heat was super ridiulous but that 
                hiking trail was gorgeous. The foliage of this state was very interesting for sure. The similarities and differences 
                provided in the plant life truly make up for all the heat. This is some of the sheer beauty this state has to offer and 
                there is so much more to be explored here.<a class="readmore"> read more..</a>

            <h3>Idaho Drive at Sunset! </h3>
            <p class="textentry">
                <p class="date">May 4th 2015</p><br> Not really a hiking photo such as the rest, however this was a sight that could not 
                be passed up for a photo. The sunset on this drive was absolutely stunning. I did play around with an editor to give an 
                extra effect to this picture. In my travels so far Idaho has some of the most amazing cloud formations and sunsets.

            <h3>A Small Part of a Large Adventure </h3>
            <p class="textentry">
                <p class="date">April 18th 2015</p><br> I had made friends with a shop owner in Montana, We decided to take a day off from 
                the busy day to day life. He showed me this fantastic area for hikinng I had never been to before. While I cannot recall 
                the exact location it was near Chico hot springs. The entire trail felt like being in another world, as if our world 
                contained more magic. This will forever be one of my favorite memories and hiking trails<a class="readmore"> read more..</a>
