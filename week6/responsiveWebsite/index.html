                    Welcome to my lovely creations page! This page will sever as my outlet for my 
                    crochet creations. I started crocheting when I was 14, however I did not get super invested not creative with it until I was 
                    roughly 19 years old. My first attempt at amigurumi was an adorable little turtle! Since than I have taken my skills to an 
                    entirely new level making smaller and more detailed items as well. Here we will explore different patterns, ones that:

                    <li>I have tested personally</li>
                    <li>Turned out super cute</li>
                    <li>Did not look like they should have</li>
                    <li>Trouble shooting random questions</li>
                    <li>Sharing tips and tricks</li>
                </ul>

                and so much more! Everyone starts at the beginning, and we all need practice to make what we want to make. I remember when I first 
                started I had some goofy looking creations that I, at the time, felt ashamed of. Now I look back and giggle at my mistakes and recall 
                all the fun I had making all of the stuffed animals, booties and hats. I hope you all enjoy this page. Please link all shared sources 
                to patterns you are sharing so that proper credit is given where it is due. I will also note creations that are entirely free handed!
